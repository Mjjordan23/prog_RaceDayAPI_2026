# RaceDay API

## Student Information

**Name:** Murendeni Nethenzheni
**Student Number:** ST10396326
**Module:** PROG6212 – Programming 2B
**Assessment:** POE Part 1 – System Planning and Database



## Project Description

RaceDay is a full-stack event management platform designed for South African running, walking, and cycling events.

The system allows **Organisers** to create and manage sporting events, categories, participant enrolments, and race results. **Participants** can create accounts, browse available events, enter events by category, view their enrolments, and track their personal results.

Part 1 focuses on the system planning and database design before the API implementation.
